# CPSC 449 - WEB BACKEND ENGINEERING

## Task Manager Web Application
This repository contains a Flask-based web application for managing tasks. Users can create, view, update, and delete tasks with authentication and authorization mechanisms in place.

## Overview
The Task Manager Web Application uses Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. It utilizes MySQL for data storage and includes features such as user authentication, task management, and API endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks.

## Features
- User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely using OAuth for authentication. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
- Task Management: Authenticated users can create, view, update, and delete tasks. Tasks are associated with the user who created them.
- Session Management: User sessions are maintained using Flask's session management system, allowing users to stay logged in across multiple requests.
- RESTful API: The application provides RESTful API endpoints for interacting with tasks, allowing integration with other services or front-end applications.
- Admin Portal: An admin portal allows administrators to manage user accounts. Administrators can view user accounts from the portal.
- We added the AI feature that will help to plan the day based on the unorganized task list, user role, and the goal for the day. Initially, we took 10 dummy roles: student, doctor, engineer, artist, etc. The day can be planned using 5 goal models: easy mode, productivity mode, learning mode, and so on.
- The form data will be submitted, and then the OpenAI's GPT4o model will prepare the schedule for the day based on the requirements. 

Scalable Strategies:
- Caching: Redis is used as a caching layer to improve performance by caching frequently accessed data.
- Load Balancing: NGINX is configured as a load balancer to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers, improving the responsiveness and availability of the application.
- Distributed Caching: Redis is configured for distributed caching, allowing the storage and retrieval of cache data across multiple application instances.
  
## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- MySQL server
- Redis server
- NGINX
  
## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sri-datta/Task_Manager.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd Task_Manager
```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Uncomment the app_secret_key and provide a secret

5. Set up the MySQL database:

    - Create a MySQL database.
    - Update the database connection details in app.py by uncommenting the connection code and adding your details

6. Set up the Redis server:

    - Ensure the Redis server is running on localhost with default port 6379.

7. Configure NGINX as a load balancer:

    - Update NGINX configuration to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the Flask application.
    - Ensure NGINX is configured to forward requests to the appropriate Flask instances.

8. Run the application:
  
  ```shell
python app.py
```

9. Access the application in your web browser at `https://http://localhost:5001`


## Usage
- Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.
- Add, update, or delete tasks from the dashboard.
- Log out when finished.
  
## Admin Portal
- Access the admin portal by logging in with the admin credentials:
   - Email: admin@gmail.com
   - Password: Admin@123
- Manage user accounts and view user details from the admin dashboard.
